This is an educational project based on the book 
[*Implementing functional languages: a tutorial*,
by Simon Peyton Jones and David Lester, 1992](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/Papers/pj-lester-book/)

In the preface to this book it states that the code is written on Miranda, but in fact, in the modern PDF-version, all of the code is written in Haskell. In the code, there are gaps that the student must fill in yourself. I'll try to do it, using modern Haskell library that I know. In particular, I have been studying the possibilities of [regex-applicative](https://github.com/feuerbach/regex-applicative) in implementing lexers and parsers.
