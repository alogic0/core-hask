# core-hask

This is an educational project based on the book 
[*Implementing functional languages: a tutorial*,
Simon Peyton Jones and David Lester, 1992](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/Papers/pj-lester-book/)

I try to rewrite all the code from tutorial on Haskell, instead of Miranda as it was originally written. Also I study the possibilities of [regex-applicative](https://github.com/feuerbach/regex-applicative) for implementing lexers and parsers.
